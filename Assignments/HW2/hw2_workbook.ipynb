In this homework we'll use Hadoop MapReduce to implement your first parallelized machine learning algorithm: Naive Bayes. As you develop your implementation you'll test it on a small dataset that matches the 'Chinese Example' in the _Manning, Raghavan and Shutze_ reading for Week 2. For the main task in this assignment you'll be working with a small subset of the Enron Spam/Ham Corpus. By the end of this assignment you should be able to:\n",

The key idea being that it is a 'stateless' paradigm, which uses higher-order functions. Programming in thhis paradigm is done in expressions. MapReduce exemplify these ideas in the stateless and higher-order functions such as Map and Reduce.\n",

And when they are done, the Shuffling step reorganizes the output from the Mapper so they are sorted by key before they are used as input to the Reducer. It is costly becasue of the sorting and network transfer involved in this step.\n",

The order inversion pattern is applied at the data analysis phase, ordering the data before it arrives at the Reduce phase.\n"

    "# Question 3: Understanding Total Order Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge in distributed computing is to break a problem into a set of sub-problems that can be performed without communicating with each other. Ideally, we should be able to define an arbirtary number of splits and still get the right result, but that is not always possible. Parallelization becomes particularly challenging when we need to make comparisons between records, for example when sorting. Total Order Sort allows us to order large datasets in a way that enables efficient retrieval of results. Before beginning this assignment, make sure you have read and understand the [Total Order Sort Notebook](https://github.com/UCB-w261/main/tree/master/HelpfulResources/TotalSortGuide/_total-sort-guide-spark2.01-JAN27-2017.ipynb). You can skip the first two MRJob sections, but the rest of section III and all of section IV are **very** important (and apply to Hadoop Streaming) so make sure to read them closely.

In the case of an unordered sort, keys are assigned to partitions based on their numeric values. For example, one partition can hold all keys between 0 and 99, another can have all keys between 100 and 199, and so on. The keys within a partition are sorted, but there is no order between the partitions. Finally, the total order sort ensure that, in addition to the keys being assigned to partitions based on their numeric value and the keys being sorted in the partitions, the partitions themselves are assigned in order so that the key groups are in the correct sequence. \n",

First, a partition file or function needs to exist inside the Mapper. This is where a partition key is generated to instruct Haddop how to partition records. Second, we need to drop the internal partition key inside the Reducer. This is where the key used for partitioning is drop and the reducer recovers the orignal (key, value) pairs. Finally, there is a post-processing step to order the partitions. While the partitions (i.e., files names) are ordered, the partitions keys may not be.\n",

    "# Question 7: Naive Bayes Inference.\n",
    "In the next two questions you'll write code to parallelize the Naive Bayes calculations that you performed above. We'll do this in two phases: one MapReduce job to perform training and a second MapReduce to perform inference. While in practice we'd need to train a model before we can use it to classify documents, for learning purposes we're going to develop our code in the opposite order. By first focusing on the pieces of information/format we need to perform the classification (inference) task you should find it easier to develop a solid implementation for training phase when you get to question 8 below. In both of these questions we'll continue to use the Chinese example corpus from the textbook to help us test our MapReduce code as we develop it. Below we've reproduced the corpus, test set and model in text format that matches the Enron data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ run the provided cells to create the example files and load them in to HDFS. Then take a closer look at __`NBmodel.txt`__. This text file represents a Naive Bayes model trained (with Laplace +1 smoothing) on the example corpus. What are the 'keys' and 'values' in this file? Which record means something slightly different than the rest? The value field of each record includes two numbers which will be helpful for debugging but which we don't actually need to perform inference -- what are they? [`HINT`: _This file represents the model from Example 13.1 in the textbook, if you're having trouble getting oriented try comparing our file to the numbers in that example._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ When performing Naive Bayes in practice instead of multiplying the probabilities (as in equation 13.3) we add their logs (as in equation 13.4). Why do we choose to work with log probabilities? If we had an unsmoothed model, what potential error could arise from this transformation?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ Documents 6 and 8 in the test set include a word that did not appear in the training corpus (and as a result does not appear in the model). What should we do at inference time when we need a class conditional probability for this word?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ The goal of our MapReduce job is to stream over the test set and classify each document by peforming the calculation from equation 13.4. To do this we'll load the model file (which contains the probabilities for equation 13.4) into memory on the nodes where we do our mapping. This is called an in-memory join. Does loading a model 'state' like this depart from the functional programming principles? Explain why or why not. From a scability perspective when would this kind of memory use be justified? when would it be unwise?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code:__ Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/classify_mapper.py`__. Read the docstring carefully to understand how this script should work and the format it should return. Run the provided unit tests to confirm that your script works as expected then write a Hadoop streaming job to classify the Chinese example test set. [`HINT 1:` _you shouldn't need a reducer for this one._ `HINT 2:` _Don't forget to add the model file to the_ `-files` _parameter in your Hadoop streaming job so that it gets shipped to the mapper nodes where it will be accessed by your script._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __f) short response:__ In our test example and in the Enron data set we have fairly short documents. Since these fit fine in memory on a mapper node we didn't need a reducer and could just do all of our calculations in the mapper. However with much longer documents (eg. books) we might want a higher level of parallelization -- for example we might want to process parts of a document on different nodes. In this hypothetical scenario how would our algorithm design change? What could the mappers still do? What key-value structure would they emit? What would the reducers have to do as a last step?"

    "> __a)__ Tthe keys in NBModel.txt are the particular terms, such as 'chinese' and 'tokyo'. The values are the sequence of four numerical elements that follow each key, such as '0.0,1.0,0.111111111111,0.142857142857'.\n",
    ">The ClassPriors record means something different than the rest. While the others are associated with specific terms, the ClassPriors records has information about the ClassPriors for each class.\n",
    "> The first two numbers in the value field are not directly used in the inference. They are the counts that the term appear in class '0' and class '1'. The third and fourth numbers are the actual conditional probabilities that are used in the inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__  Using log probabilities allows us to use a Sum of conditional probabilities instead of a Multiplication of them. Such multiplication could result in a floating point underflow. If we used the unsmoothed model, we could get to a situation where we are trying to calculate the log of zero, which is undefined.\n",
    "\n",

The end result of the MapReduce job you write in this question should be a model text file that looks just like the example (`NBmodel.txt`) that we created by hand above.\n",

We now want to retrieve those pieces of information while streaming over a corpus. The bulk of the task will be very similar to the word counting excercises you've already done but you may want to consider a slightly different key-value record structure to efficiently tally counts for each class. \n",

The hard part is the timing: you'll need to make sure you have the counts totalled up _before_ you start estimating the class conditional probabilities for each word. It would be best (i.e. most scalable) if we could find a way to do this tallying without storing the whole vocabulary in memory... Use an appropriate MapReduce design pattern to implement this efficiently! \n",

    "* __a) make a plan:__  Fill in the docstrings for __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ to appropriately reflect the format that each script will input/output. [`HINT:` _the input files_ (`enronemail_1h.txt` & `chineseTrain.txt`) _have a prespecified format and your output file should match_ `NBmodel.txt` _so you really only have to decide on an internal format for Hadoop_].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) implement it:__ Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ so that together they train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model __with no smoothing__. Make sure your end result is formatted correctly (see note above). Test your scripts independently and together (using `chineseTrain.txt` or test input of your own devising). When you are satisfied with your Python code design and run a Hadoop streaming command to run your job in parallel on the __chineseTrain.txt__. Confirm that your trained model matches your hand calculations from Question 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ We saw in Question 6 that adding Laplace +1 smoothing makes our classifications less sensitve to rare words. However implementing this technique requires access to one additional piece of information that we had not previously used in our Naive Bayes training. What is that extra piece of information? [`HINT:` see equation 13.7 in Manning, Raghavan and Schutze].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ There are a couple of approaches that we could take to handle the extra piece of information you identified in `c`: 1) if we knew this extra information beforehand, we could provide it to our reducer as a configurable parameter for the vocab size dynamically (_where would we get it in the first place?_). Or 2) we could compute it in the reducer without storing any bulky information in memory but then we'd need some postprocessing or a second MapReduce job to complete the calculation (_why?_). Breifly explain what is non-ideal about each of these options. \n",

    "\n",
    "* __e) code + short response:__ Choose one of the 2 options above. State your choice & reasoning in the space below then use that strategy to complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer_smooth.py`__. Test this alternate reducer then write and run a Hadoop streaming job to train an MNB model with smoothing on the Chinese example.

    "### Q9 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) train/test split:__ Run the provided code to split our Enron file into a training set and testing set then load them into HDFS. [`NOTE:` _Make sure you re calculate the vocab size for just the training set!_]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) train 2 models:__ Write Hadoop Streaming jobs to train MNB Models on the training set with and without smoothing. Save your models to local files at __`NaiveBayes/Unsmoothed/NBmodel.txt`__ and __`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.txt`__. [`NOTE:` _This naming is important because we wrote our classification task so that it expects a file of that name... if this inelegance frustrates you there is an alternative that would involve a few adjustments to your code [read more about it here](http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2013-11-23)._] Finally run the checks that we provide to confirm that your results are correct.\n",

    "* __a) code + short response:__ Let's look at the top ten words with the highest conditional probability in `Spam` and in `Ham`. We'll do this by writing a Hadoop job that sorts the model file (`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.py`). Normally we'd have to run two jobs -- one that sorts on $P(word|ham)$ and another that sorts on $P(word|spam)$. However if we slighly modify the data format in the model file then we can get the top words in each class with just one job. We've written a mapper that will do just this for you. Read through __`NaiveBayes/model_sort_mapper.py`__ and then briefly explain how this mapper will allow us to partition and sort our model file. Write a Hadoop job that uses our mapper and `/bin/cat` for a reducer to partition and sort. Print out the top 10 words in each class (where 'top' == highest conditional probability).[`HINT:` _this should remind you a lot of what we did in Question 6._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ What do you notice about the 'top words' we printed in `a`? How would increasing the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the probabilities for the top words that you identified for 'a'. How would they affect the probabilities of words that occur much more in one class than another? In summary, how does the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the bias and the variance of our model. [`NOTE:` _you do not need to code anything for this task, but if you are struggling with it you could try changing 'k' and see what happens to the test set. We don't recommend doing this exploration with the Enron data because it will be harder to see the impact with such a big vocabulary_]"
